## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Text Preservation
- **Best for text**: Pop Art, Japanese Ukiyo-e (maintain sharp edges)
- **Moderate impact**: Van Gogh, Picasso at low intensity (0.3-0.7)
- **Softens text**: Watercolor, Monet (blur effects)

### Style Intensity Guide
- **0.1-0.5**: Subtle artistic enhancement
- **0.6-1.0**: Balanced artistic transformation
- **1.1-1.5**: Strong artistic effect
- **1.6-2.0**: Maximum artistic impact

### Image Quality
- Use high-resolution source images for best results
- JPEG and PNG formats are supported
- Mobile photos are automatically oriented correctly

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface with responsive design
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV and PIL for robust image handling
- **Style Transfer**: Traditional computer vision techniques for reliability
- **Color Management**: RGB pipeline with proper EXIF orientation handling

### Style Algorithms
- **Van Gogh**: Color enhancement with canvas texture and artistic blur
- **Picasso**: Edge detection with k-means color quantization for cubist effects
- **Monet**: Gaussian blur with HSV color space enhancement
- **Kandinsky**: Geometric wave distortions with color boosting
- **Ukiyo-e**: High contrast quantization with edge overlays
- **Pop Art**: Bright color clustering with contrast enhancement
- **Watercolor**: Bilateral filtering with organic paper textures
